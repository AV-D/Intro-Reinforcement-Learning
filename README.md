## Theoritical Background

### 1. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. The agent learns from the consequences of its actions, rather than from being told explicitly what to do.

### 2. **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**
Reinforcement learning problems are typically framed as Markov Decision Processes, characterized by:
- A set of states (S)
- A set of actions (A)
- Transition dynamics (P(s'|s, a)), which define the probability of reaching state s' from state s by taking action a
- A reward function (R(s, a)), which gives the immediate reward received after transitioning from state s to s' due to action a
- A discount factor (γ), which represents the difference in importance between future rewards and immediate rewards.

### 3. **Q-Learning**
Q-Learning is an off-policy learner that seeks to find the best action to take given the current state. It's based on the notion of Q-values, which are estimates of the expected future rewards that can be obtained by taking a particular action in a particular state. The Q-value for a state-action pair (s, a) is denoted as Q(s, a).

### 4. **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**
Introduced by DeepMind, DQN integrates neural networks with Q-learning. The network is used to approximate the Q-value function, which can be complex and difficult to estimate in environments with large state spaces. The key components of DQN include:
- **Experience Replay:** To break the correlation between consecutive samples, experiences (s, a, r, s') are stored in a replay buffer and sampled randomly to train the network.
- **Fixed Q-Targets:** To stabilize training, the target network's weights are fixed and periodically updated with the weights from the training network. This prevents the moving target problem seen in traditional Q-learning.

### 5. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**
A key challenge in RL is balancing exploration (trying new things) and exploitation (using known information). This is often managed using an ε-greedy policy, where the agent selects random actions with probability ε and the best-known action with probability 1-ε.

### 6. **Environment: Lunar Lander**
The Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI Gym is a simulation where the goal is to land a space vehicle on a landing pad. The state includes positional coordinates, velocity components, angle, angular velocity, and binary leg contact indicators. Actions include firing the main engine or side thrusters.

### 7. **Training and Evaluation**
Training involves running episodes where the agent interacts with the environment, collects experiences, and updates the network parameters. The performance is typically evaluated based on the average rewards over a set number of episodes.

### 8. **Hyperparameters**
Key hyperparameters in DRL include the learning rate, discount factor, size of the replay buffer, batch size for learning, and the update frequency for the target network.

This theoretical background forms the basis for implementing a DRL solution to the Lunar Lander problem using a DQN approach.

# Deep Reinforcement Learning: Lunar Lander Solution

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to solve the "Lunar Lander" problem using OpenAI's Gym environment. The notebook includes the setup, implementation, and evaluation of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) model to control the lander.

## Environment Setup

1. **Installation of Dependencies**: The notebook begins by installing necessary packages including `gym`, `box2d-py`, and other dependencies required to run the simulation and model training.

2. **Virtual Environment**: A Python virtual environment is created and activated to manage dependencies.

## Model Implementation

- **Q-Network**: The core of the notebook is the implementation of a Q-Network, which is a neural network model that approximates the Q-value function. The network predicts the best action to take given a state of the environment.

- **Agent**: An agent is implemented to interact with the environment, collect experiences, and learn from them using the Q-Network.

- **Replay Buffer**: To improve learning stability, a replay buffer is used to store experience tuples and sample from them randomly to perform learning updates.

## Training

- The agent is trained over a series of episodes, with the state, action, reward, and next state being recorded at each step. The Q-Network is updated periodically based on batches of experiences sampled from the replay buffer.

- Hyperparameters such as the number of episodes, maximum timesteps per episode, learning rate, and epsilon values for the epsilon-greedy policy are detailed and can be adjusted to observe different learning behaviors.

## Evaluation and Visualization

- The performance of the agent is evaluated based on the average score over 100 consecutive episodes. The goal is to achieve a high average score indicating successful landings.

- Visualization tools are included to watch the trained agent perform landings in the environment.

## Experimentation

- Different models and training parameters are compared to analyze their impact on the learning performance and efficiency.

- Parameters such as learning rate, discount factor, batch size, and buffer size are discussed for further experimentation.

## Conclusion

This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to applying Deep Q-Networks to solve the Lunar Lander problem, with detailed explanations of the reinforcement learning concepts, code implementation, and results analysis.
